Sprite sheets:

Overview:

Rehash the sprite sheet and font atlas system.
Meta data interleaved with bitmap data.
Each font atlas is ALSO a sprite sheet, and should use the same basic meta data format. (?)
(However, additional font info is required to lay out the characters.)

Details:

Each line is an animation.
The line is a sequence of animation frames, each animation filling one line.
Mapping/addressing: 
    [sheet name] - "courier" or "aliens_01" - returns a ptr to Sheet
    [ani idx] - which row - ptr to nothing - ptr to Animation
    [ani frame idx] - x,y,w,h, duration - ptr to Frame
