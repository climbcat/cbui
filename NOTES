Improve & unify the UI, font and sprite systems:

Overview:

Streamline the API.
Delete unused stuff.
All raster functions to low-level unit raster.h (no data structures, just parameters)
Font stuff should also be named UI_[function name], e.g. UI_SetFont(...)
Extended raterization options.

Details:

GetFonts() -> should return a selection of font options. In various formats.
SetFontSize(pixels) -> users shouldn't worry about the enum, just have a number and select the closest one that matches
UI: layers -> Sometimes we want to draw an unrelated UI on top of a background, where the bckgrnd is already created using the UI_ stuff
UI: Fix the UI_ tree structure
UI: Have a DEBUG setting that draws all widgets, reflecting tree depth as well in terms of colour
